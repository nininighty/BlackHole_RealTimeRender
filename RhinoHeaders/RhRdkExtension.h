/** \class CRhRdkExtension

	This is the base class for RDK extensions whose interface is defined by a UUID.
	Some RDK extensions have interface files which are supplied with the RDK SDK
	(e.g., content factories) and some do not. The latter case is generally reserved
	for features which are added to the RDK after the initial SDK release and allows
	us to add extensions without breaking the SDK.

	\see CRhRdkPlugIn::RegisterExtensions()
	\see CRhRdkPlugIn::AddExtension()
