Description:
  Creates a surface through profile curves that define the surface shape and one curve

Parameters:
  args           - [in] The sweep1 arguments
  shape_blending - [in] Shape blending, where:
                        Local (shape_blending = 0), the sweep stays constant at the 
                          ends and changes more rapidly in the middle.
                        Global (shape_blending = 1), the sweep is linearly blended from
                          one end to the other, creating sweeps that taper from 
                          one cross-section curve to the other.
  brep_array     - [out] The results of the sweep.

Returns:

Description:
  Fits a SubD surface through a series of profile curves that define the SubD cross-sections and one curve that defines a SubD edge.
Parameters:
  rail_curve   [in] - A SubD-friendly NURBS curve to sweep along.
  shape_curves [in] - Array of SubD-friendly NURBS curves to sweep through.
  bSubDCorners [in] - With open curves, adds creased vertices to the SubD at both ends of the first and last curves.
  bClosedSweep [in] - Creates a SubD that is closed in the rail curve direction.
  bFrameStyle  [in] - Determines how sweep frame rotations are calculated:
                      true: Freeform - Frames are propagated based on a reference direction taken from the rail curve curvature direction.
                      false: Roadlike - Frame rotations are calculated based on a vector supplied in "frameup" and the world coordinate system.
  frame_up     [in] - A 3D vector used to calculate the frame rotations for sweep shapes (not used if bFrameStyle is true).
  result_subd  [in/out] - Pointer to an empty SubD to return the sweep result.
Returns:
  true if successful, false otherwise.
Remarks:
  Shape curves must be in the proper order and orientation.
  Shape curves must have the same point counts and rail curves must have the same point counts.
  Shape curves will relocated to the nearest pair of Greville points on the rails.
  Shape curves will be made at each pair of rail edit points where there isn't an input shape.
