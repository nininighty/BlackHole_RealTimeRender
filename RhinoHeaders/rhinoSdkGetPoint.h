Description:
  CRhinoGetPoint is the Rhino SDK user interface tool used to get points.
  It is derived from CRhinoGet which is used to provide the command prompt
  and option setting tools that are common to all the Rhino SDK getting
  tools.

  Step 1:
    Use the CRhinoGet member functions to specify command prompt, 
    command options, and what types of non-point input are acceptable.
    For example, if you want the user to be able to either pick a point
    or type a number, then you would call CRhinoGet::AcceptNumber(true).
    The default command prompt is a localized "Pick point" prompt.

  Step 2:
    Use the CRhinoGetPoint member functions to customize point
    picking behavior.

  Step 3:
    Call CRhinoGetPoint::GetPoint();

  Step 4:
    Examine the value returned by CRhinoGet::Result() and react
    accordingly.

Example:
    CRhinoCommand::result my_center_radius_getter(
                                ON_3dPoint& my_center, 
                                double* my_radius 
                                )
    {
      double radius = 1.0;
      ON_3dPoint center(0,0,0);

      CRhinoGetPoint gp;
      gp.SetCommandPrompt( L"Center point" );
      gp.SetCommandPromptDefault( L"(0,0,0)" );
      gp.AddCommandOptionNumber( L"radius", &radius, "New radius",
                                  false, ON_ZERO_TOLERANCE);
      gp.AcceptNothing(true);
      for (;;)
      {
        gp.GetPoint();
        switch (gp.Result())
        {
        case CRhinoGet::cancel:
          return CRhinoCommand::cancel; // user pressed ESCAPE
          break;

        case CRhinoGet::nothing:
          // user pressed enter - use default center value
          break;

        case CRhinoGet::option:
          // user changed radius value - radius automatically updated
          continue;
          break;

        case CRhinoGet::point:
          center = gp.Point();
          break;

        default:
          continue;
          break;
        }
        break;
      }
      my_center = center;
      *my_radius = radius;
      return CRhinoCommand::success;
    }
