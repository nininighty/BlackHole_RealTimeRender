    Description:
      Called by the framework when a drop operation is to occur.
    Parameters:
      pWnd        [in] Points to the window the cursor is currently over.
      pDataObject [in] Points to the data object that contains the data to be dropped.
      dropDefault [in] The effect that the user chose for the default drop operation based on the current

      dropList    [in] A list of the drop effects that the drop source supports. Drop effect values can be
                       combined using the bitwise OR (|) operation. Drop effects are discussed in the Comments
                       section.
      point       [in] Contains the location of the cursor, in pixels, relative to the screen.
    Returns:
      The drop effect that resulted from the drop attempt at the location specified by point. Drop effects are
      discussed in the Comments section.
    Comments:
      The framework first calls this function. If it does not handle the drop, the framework then calls OnDrop.
      Typically, you will override OnDropEx in the view class to support right mouse-button drag and drop. Typically,
      the view class OnDrop is used to handle the case of support for simple drag and drop.

      The default implementation of COleDropTarget::OnDropEx calls CView::OnDropEx. By default, CView::OnDropEx
      simply returns a dummy value to indicate the OnDrop member function should be called.

      Drop effects describe the action associated with a drop operation. See the following list of drop effects: 
        DROPEFFECT_NONE   A drop would not be allowed.
        DROPEFFECT_COPY   A copy operation would be performed.
        DROPEFFECT_MOVE   A move operation would be performed.
        DROPEFFECT_LINK   A link from the dropped data to the original data would be established.
        DROPEFFECT_SCROLL Indicates that a drag scroll operation is about to occur or is occurring in the target.

      For more information, see IDropTarget::Drop in the Platform SDK.

      The default geometry type filter permits selection of all 
      types of geometry.  This is only valid if EnableDropOnObject()
      is set to true.
  
    Returns:
      An unsigned int "object_filter".  If the bit from an
      CRhinoGetObject::GEOMETRY_TYPE_FILTER enum value is set
      in the geometry_filter, then OnDragOver() will permit 
      selection of object's that have that type of geometry.
      If geometry_filter is 0xFFFFFFFF, then OnDragOver()
      can select all types of geometry.

    Example:
      If (GeometryFilter() | curve_object) != 0, then GetObjects()
      will permit curves to be selected.

    Description:

      can be used to restrict which objects can be selected.  
      Control of the type of geometry (points, curves, surfaces,
      meshes, etc.) is provided by CRhinoGetObject::SetGeometryFilter.
      The geometry attribute filter is used to require the selected
      geometry to have certain attributes (open, closed, etc.).
      The default attribute filter permits selection of all types of 
      geometry.  This is only valid if EnableDropOnObject() is set

    Parameters:
      geometry_attribute_filter - [in] an unsigned int made by 
          bitwise or-ing ( | ) values from the 
          CRhinoGetObject::GEOMETRY_ATTRIBUTE_FILTER enum.
          If you pass 0, then all geometry attributes will be acceptable.

    Example:
      If you want to be able to select open curves or solids, then
      you would make a call like

         unsigned int geometry_type_filter = 0;
         unsigned int geometry_attribute_filter = 0;
         geometry_type_filter |= CRhinoGetObject::curve;
