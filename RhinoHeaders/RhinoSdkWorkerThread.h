Description:
  In any function that allocates memory use by the core
  Rhino application, create a CRhCoreAppActivity class
  on the first line and all memory will come from the
  correct pool and the function will work in both
  ordinary running and while a worker thread is running.

  It is critical to make sure memory comes from the main
  pool in things that handle Windows events.

  Description:
    Override Worker to perform time consuming calculations that

    Use member variables in your derived class to pass information
    in and out of your Worker function.

            // if you have a time consuming loop with no memory
            // allocation.

            // on object that are in the main thread.

            // Be sure to get this right, or we get hard to trace
            // crashes that happen in other places after a cancel.
          }

  Remarks:
    Do NOT create dialogs and do NOT call Rhino SDK functions in a Worker()
    function except for those listed below.

    You may call the following Rhino SDK functions in a Worker function:
      CRhinoApp.Print
      CRhinoDoc::AddPointObject
      CRhinoDoc::AddPointCloudObject
      CRhinoDoc::AddCurveObject
      CRhinoDoc::AddSurfaceObject
      CRhinoDoc::AddMeshObject
      CRhinoDoc::AddBrepObject

    Other than adding objects, don't mess with the document,
    application, or views in a Worker() function.

  /*
  Description:
    Cleans up runtime caches that exist on any objects
    whose memory belongs on the main thread stack or heap
    but whose runtime cache may be created in worker
    thread's stack or worker heap.  Basically, this function
    needs to call the ON_Object::DestroyRuntimeCache() member
    functions of breps, curves and surfaces that exist in
    the main thread's stack or heap but are used in closest
    point or intersection calculations performed in the
    Worker() function.

  Parameters:
    bDelete - [in] pass this parameter on to the
      ON_Object::DestroyRuntimeCache(bDelete) function.
      Basically, if bDelete is true, then you should 
      free/delete runtime cache information that is on
      the heap.  If bDelete is false, then you should
      simply zero out pointers on main heap/stack classes
      that point to memory allocated from the worker
      pool.  If this is confusing, then you need to get
      help before you check in anything using cancel 
      threads.
      

  Remarks:
    It is critical to do this right.  If you don't we end
    up with hrd to repeat crashes that happen one to many
    commands after the actual cancel event.

    This function is pure virtual so that any developer
    using a cancel thread is forced to think about cleaning
    up runtime memory caches.  If you are at all confused,
    then please ask for help or do not use cancel threads.
    
    Test thoroughly before checking in.
