/** \class IRhRdkCurrentEnvironment

	This is the interface to the current environments for background, skylighting and
	reflection / refraction.

	Ideally this interface would be deprecated and replaced by ON_3dmRenderSettings
	but we can't do that as the latter has no current environment interface.

	The Usage and Purpose enums have the same meaning as those in ON_3dmRenderSettings::EnvironmentUsage
	but the values are different so be careful about the possible need to convert between them.
