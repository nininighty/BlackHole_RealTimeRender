/** \class CRhRdkContent

	Abstract base class for all kinds of render content. A 'render content' (AKA 'content') is a
	material, environment or texture used for rendering.

	Contents have a unique type id which is the same for all instances of the same class and an instance id
	which is unique for each instance. They know how to provide a shader for rendering, how to read and write
	their state as XML and how to create their own user interfaces.

	There are two flavors of content in the RDK -- temporary and persistent. It is very important to understand
	the distinction between a temporary content instance and a persistent content instance, and the fact that a
	temporary instance (and all its children) can become persistent. Persistent content is registered with a
	document and is usually (but not always) owned by it.

	Temporary contents get created and deleted very often during the normal operation of the RDK. In fact, just
	about anything the user clicks on might result in a temporary content being created and deleted again. They
	are created by the content browser, the thumbnail rendering, and so on. They are 'free floating' and are
	owned by whomever created them. They do not appear in the modeless UI, they do not get saved in the 3dm
	file, and they can freely be deleted again after use.

	Contrast this with persistent contents which are attached to a document. They are always owned by RDK,
	appear in the modeless UI and get saved in the 3dm file. Pointers to persistent contents should never
	be stored by clients; you should only store their instance ids and look them up again using
	CRhRdkDocument::FindContentInstance(). They can be deleted only after detaching them from the document.

	CRhRdkDocument::CreateContentByType() is the highest-level function for creating a content. It creates it,
	initializes it, adds it to the document and sends many events. It even records undo. You cannot call this
	method from just anywhere. It must only be called by 'UI code'; scripts or buttons on a dialog. It results
	in a persistent (usually top-level) content being attached to the document and appearing in all the RDK UI
	elements that display contents, like the thumbnail and tree views. If you call this method and specify a
	parent and child-slot name, your new content will be attached to the document-resident parent as a child
	and the UI will be updated accordingly.

	If you want to create a complex content that has children from the moment it is created, you can add the
	children in Initialize(). You want to create a temporary child content that is not attached to any document
	and after that you want to attach it to your parent content -- which RDK is about to attach to a document.
	The sequence of operation is:

	1. The user asks to create your content by pressing a button or menu and choosing your content from the browser.

	2. The RDK uses a factory to create it and calls Initialize().

	3. Your override of Initialize() uses the factory to create your child content and attaches it to the parent
	   by calling SetChild().

	4. RDK attaches the root content (parent) to the specified document and sends events to update the UI.

	The important point is that everything is temporary while the content structure is being built. Only
	after the whole structure is complete will the top-level parent be attached to the document making the
	whole structure persistent.
