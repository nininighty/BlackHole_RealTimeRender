/** \class IRhRdkPostEffect

	This is the new post effect interface. It is implemented by both the RDK for built-in post effects 
	and (partly) by 3rd-party plug-ins for custom post effects.

	In the new system, post effects consist of:
	- 'Early' post effects like Glare and Glow which operate on HDR (float) image data.
	- 'Tone mapping' post effects like Filmic which convert HDR image data to LDR (8-bit) image data.
	- 'Late' post effects like Gamma which operate on LDR image data.

	Post effects can be implemented to run on the CPU or the GPU at the discretion of the implementer.

	The post-processing runs in a 'pipeline' as follows:

	- The renderer produces a rendering in a frame buffer composed of channels.
	  The channels are HDR capable.
	- The early post effect manager's post effects are executed to produce modified versions of some of
	  these channels.
	- One of the tone mapping post effect manager's post effects is executed to perform tone mapping.
	- The RGBA channels are clamped to be between 0 and 1, converting the image from HDR to LDR.
	- The late post effect manager's post effects are executed to perform gamma correction and so on.
	- Finally, the RGBA channels left behind by these processes are converted to a displayable form.

	Old system (V5, V6)                  New system (V7+)
	-------------------                  ----------------
	- Post Effect Plug-ins (PEPs)        Early post effects (run before tone mapping).
	- Exposure
	  * Tone Mapping                     Tone mapping post effects.
	  * Gamma, Dithering, De-noising     Late post effects (run after tone mapping).

	Notes for 3rd-party post effect developers
	------------------------------------------
	- You should not try to implement IRhRdkPostEffect directly. Rather, you should subclass one of
	  CRhRdkEarlyPostEffect, CRhRdkToneMappingPostEffect or CRhRdkLatePostEffect.
	- If you want your post effect to be run before tone mapping, it should be an early post effect
	  implemented by subclassing CRhRdkEarlyPostEffect.
	- If your post effect performs Tone Mapping, it should be a Tone Mapping post effect implemented
	  by subclassing CRhRdkToneMappingPostEffect.
	- If you want your post effect to be run after tone mapping, it should be a late post effect
	  implemented by subclassing CRhRdkLatePostEffect.

/** \class IRhRdkPostEffectPipeline

	This object provides a way for post effects to access the frame buffer channels from a rendering and create
	new channels containing post-processed information which can be passed to the next post effect in the chain.

	Consider a simple post effect that just modifies the red component of a rendering. It will call GetChannelForRead()
	to get the RGBA channel as its input, and it will call GetChannelForWrite() to get a new RGBA channel for its output.
	It will then read the input channel, do calculations and write to the output channel. When finished, it will
	call IChannel::Commit() passing on the output channel. Because both channels have the same identifier, this will
	replace the old channel with the new one so that subsequent post effects in the chain will use the new channel instead
	of the original. Note that this will only replace the channel used by the pipeline. The original channel will still
	exist in the frame buffer. This system allows any post effect to access any number of channels for reading and
	create any number of new channels which may or may not replace existing channels depending on the channel id.
	The final stage (convert to 8-bit) operates on the channels left in the pipeline by the post effect chain to
	produce the final 32-bit RGBA image.

	It is also possible for a post effect to create and use any number of 'scratch' channels. If a post effect needs
	a temporary pixel buffer for some intermediate results, it can call GetChannelForWrite() with a custom (random) id.
	Once it is finished with this scratch channel, it will automatically be discarded by the pipeline.
