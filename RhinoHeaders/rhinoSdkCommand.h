  Description:
    Rhino calls uses the virtual ReplayHistory functions to
    to remake an objects when inputs have changed.  
    If a command supports history, it must override exactly
    one of the ReplayHistory functions.  Simple commands
    can use the simple version of replay history that just
    just generates a new object.  Complex commands, like
    Project and Intersect need to override the complex
    version of replay history that uses a results[] array
    to return multiple objects.
  Parameters:
    history - [in]
      History information the command record when it first 
      created the existing objects.

    results - [in/out] (complex version)
      results[i].m_objects[0] - [in]  existing object
      results[i].m_objects[1] - [out] updated object

      The input array has the objects that were
      created by the command in results[i].m_objects[0]. 

      ReplayHistory is responsible for creating replacements
      and putting them in results[i].m_objects[1].  The replacements
      must NOT be added to the document.
      The results[] array can be grown if there are new "updated" objects
      that do not replace an existing object.  In this case
      set the m_objects[0] pointer to NULL.  An input
      results[i].m_objects[0] can be set to NULL if no replacement
      can be calculated.

      If results[i].m_objects[0] and results[i].m_objects[1] are
      both not NULL, then m_objects[1] will replace m_objects[0].
      If results[i].m_objects[0] is not NULL and results[i].m_objects[1]
      is NULL, then results[i].m_objects[0] is deleted.
      If results[i].m_objects[0] is NULL and results[i].m_objects[1]
      is not NULL, then results[i].m_objects[1] is added.
  Returns:
    The simple version returns either NULL or an updated object.
    The complex version returns true if Rhino should process 
    the information in results[] and false otherwise.
