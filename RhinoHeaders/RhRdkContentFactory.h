/** \class CRhRdkContentFactory

	This class is a factory for producing a certain type of content.
	You must create and implement a subclass for each content type that your renderer supports.

	Content factories are RDK extensions. You usually add new content factories to the system when you
	are called on your implementation of CRhRdkPlugIn::RegisterExtensions(). If necessary, you can also
	add new factories later by calling RhRdkAddExtension(). Factories so added can be found again later
	by calling RhRdkContentFactories() which returns an IRhRdkContentFactories interface.

	When you add a factory to the factory collection, a set of tests are performed on the factory
	before it is allowed to be added. The factory is only added if the following succeeds:

	 - CRhRdkContentFactory::Initialize() must return \e true.
	 - CRhRdkContentFactory::NewContent() must return a valid content.
	 - CRhRdkContent::Initialize() must return \e true.

	If these tests succeed, RDK takes ownership of the factory object and sends the
	OnFactoryAdded event. Otherwise, the factory is considered bad and is deleted.
